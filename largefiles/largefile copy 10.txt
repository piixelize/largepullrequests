Something big I feel it happening
Oh whoa oh oh oh whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh whoa
Oh oh oh oh whoa
Something big
Whoa
Yeah, yeah
If we stomp our feet, the ground will shake
If we clap our hands, the walls will break
Yell so loud we forget our names
'Cause something big is happening
Take this rock and start a fire
Raise this up, we're feeling high
They can't tell us anything
'Cause something big is happening
Something big I feel it happening
Out of my control
Pushing and pulling and it's grabbing me
Feel it in my bones like
Oh oh oh oh whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh
Something big is happening whoa

Something big I feel it happening oh

Whoa, oh oh oh oh whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh

Play the lotto you might win it
It's like 25 for life so you bust out of prison
Something's in the air, something's in the air
It's like that feeling when you're just about to kill it
Take your last shot you know you're gonna hit it
Somethings in the air, somethings in the air
Whoa oh oh oh oh
Something big I feel it happening
Out of my control
Pushing and pulling and it's grabbing me
Feel it in my bones like

Whoa oh oh oh oh oh whoa
Something big
It's like that feeling when you're 'bout to win the medal
And you worked so hard that you knew you wouldn't settle
Hands are in the air, hands are in the air
When they hear you when you thought they wouldn't listen
It's like an anthem that the whole worlds singing
Hands are in the air, hands are in the air
Whoa oh oh oh oh
Something big I feel it happening

Push and pull and then it's grabbing me
Feel it in my bones like,
